# Blinky

This is a small CLI-tool I made for blink(1), as an alternative to the Blink1Control-app on OS X. I will probably add more features later but it currently supports:

* Manual changing availability status
* Automatic availability status from Skype (OS X only, manually setting Busy or Away overrides this)
* Schedules ([fika](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fika_%28coffee_break%29) 10:00 and 15:00)

## Installation

    npm install

## Run

    node .
